# Recipe App

> The Recipe app is a fully functional website that allows users to keep track of all their recipes, and ingredients. It will allow users to save ingredients, keep track of what they have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what they have and what they are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow users to make them public so anyone can access them.
